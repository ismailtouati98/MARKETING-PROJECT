# MARKETING-ADIDAS-PROJECT
Adidas is a major player in global sportswear, with strong U.S. sales. This analysis explores sales performance by product category, customer demographics, and region. The goal is to identify growth opportunities, address underperformance, and understand buying behavior, helping refine strategies and strengthen Adidas' market position in the U.S.
Marketing Analytics Project Proposal


The dataset contains information related to sales in the US, including details such as:
•	Sales by region, potentially breaking down performance in different US states or cities.
•	Product categories such as footwear, apparel, and accessories.
•	Time period of the sales data, focusing on a specific fiscal year (or potentially multiple years).
•	Demographic data on customers, which could include age, gender, or income level.
This dataset likely focuses on sales, marketing, and customer insights, providing a robust base for analysis in the retail industry.
Market Problem:
From an initial analysis, a few potential challenges can be addressed:
1.	Sales stagnation: Identifying regions or product categories that are underperforming or showing declining sales trends.
2.	Ineffective marketing: Insights into whether marketing strategies are targeting the right demographics or regions.
3.	Customer segmentation: Identifying key customer segments that contribute most to sales and determining how well they are being served.

Problem Approach/Solving the Problem:
The problem can be addressed through the following steps:
1.	Data Cleaning: Ensuring the dataset is free from duplicates, handling missing data, and standardizing units of measurement.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
o	Analyze trends over time (e.g., quarterly sales performance).
o	Investigate regional disparities in sales and identify potential causes.
o	Analyze product performance by category to identify top-performing and underperforming products.
3.	Customer Segmentation: By using methods like RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to segment customers and focus on the most valuable ones.
4.	Visualizations: Creating visual representations such as:
o	Heatmaps to show regional performance.
o	Time-series graphs demonstrate sales trends.
o	Customer segment distribution charts.
5.	Predictive Modeling: Building predictive models to forecast future sales based on historical data and customer behavior.
6.	Conclusion and Recommendations: Provide actionable insights for Adidas to focus marketing efforts, optimize product offerings, and adjust regional strategies.


Tools:
•	Python: For data manipulation (Pandas, NumPy) and visualization (Seaborn, Matplotlib).
•	Jupyter Notebook: To conduct and present the analysis.
•	Tableau or Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards that visually communicate insights.
•	Excel: For preliminary exploration of data and reporting.
Timeline:
•	Week 1: Data cleaning and exploratory analysis.
•	Week 2: Data visualization and customer segmentation.
•	Week 3: Predictive modeling and deeper analysis.
•	Week 4: Final report preparation and dashboard creation.
